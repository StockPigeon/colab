    You MUST follow this exact process for {ticker}:
    1) Use investment_data_tool to get company_name, business_phase_inputs, and business_phase_classification.
    2) Use the most recent SEC filing link in business_phase_inputs.latest_sec_url as the source.

    4) OUTPUT ONLY the template below and NOTHING else. No preamble. No commentary.

    PHASE DEFINITIONS & VALUATION METHODS (use ONLY the ones for the chosen phase):

    Phase 1: STARTUP
    - Valuation Methods: Forward Price to Sales, Total Addressable Market (TAM)
    - Why These Fit: Company is pre-profit with expanding losses. Valuation relies on future revenue potential and market opportunity size.
    - Avoid: P/E ratios, DCF models, any earnings-based methods

    Phase 2: HYPERGROWTH
    - Valuation Methods: Forward Price to Sales, Price to Gross Profit
    - Why These Fit: Company shows improving unit economics with shrinking losses. Valuation focuses on revenue trajectory and gross profit margins.
    - Avoid: P/E ratios, DCF models

    Phase 3: SELF FUNDING
    - Valuation Methods: Price to Sales, Price to Gross Profit
    - Why These Fit: Company is near breakeven, validating its business model. Current revenue and gross profit provide reliable valuation anchors.
    - Avoid: Forward/Trailing P/E, Reverse DCF

    Phase 4: OPERATING LEVERAGE
    - Valuation Methods: Forward Price to Earnings, Forward Price to Free Cash Flow
    - Why These Fit: Company demonstrates scalable profitability. Forward earnings and cash flow reflect the trajectory.
    - Avoid: Dividend yield models

    Phase 5: CAPITAL RETURN
    - Valuation Methods: Trailing Price to Earnings, Trailing Price to Free Cash Flow, Reverse DCF
    - Why These Fit: Company is mature with stable operations and capital returns. Current earnings and cash generation drive valuation.
    - Avoid: High growth multiples, forward P/S

    Phase 6: DECLINE
    - Valuation Methods: Price to Book, Liquidation Value, Asset-Based Valuation
    - Why These Fit: Traditional growth valuation methods are unreliable for declining businesses due to deteriorating fundamentals.
    - Avoid: Growth multiples, forward earnings, DCF

    You are now executing a moat analysis protocol.
    Follow each instruction precisely and in order.

    Your Mission

    for company {ticker}

    Retrieve current financial data and Morningstar analysis

    Evaluate all five moat sources with evidence

    Classify moat size and direction using STRICT CRITERIA

    Output a clean Markdown report (DO NOT wrap in code blocks)

    🛡️ Moat Size Definitions
    Wide Moat (20+ years durability)

    Network Effects: Each new user materially increases value for others; difficult to replicate at scale

    Switching Costs: Customers are effectively locked in; switching risks revenue loss or operational disruption

    Intangible Assets: Brand provides significant pricing power; exclusive licenses or patents

    Low-Cost Production: Lowest cost structure competitors struggle to match

    Counter-Positioning: Incumbents cannot copy the model without self-harm

    Narrow Moat (3–10 years durability)

    Network Effects: Loyal users but not locked in; niche network

    Switching Costs: Some friction; customers stay due to habit or convenience

    Intangible Assets: Some brand loyalty but price-sensitive customers

    Low-Cost Production: Partial cost advantage, often regionally limited

    Counter-Positioning: Challenges incumbents, but incumbents can fight back

    No Moat (No durable advantage)

    Network Effects: No benefit when users join; small network

    Switching Costs: Customers leave easily; low attachment

    Intangible Assets: Undifferentiated brand with many substitutes

    Low-Cost Production: Higher costs than peers

    Counter-Positioning: Same business model as competitors

    📈 Moat Direction

    Widening: Rising engagement, margin expansion, brand strengthening

    Stable: Flat growth/margins; high retention but no new advantages

    Narrowing: Falling margins, declining engagement, eroding differentiation

    ⚠️ Critical Note on Counter-Positioning

    Counter-positioning exists only when incumbents are structurally unable to copy the business model without damaging their existing economics
    (e.g., Netflix streaming vs Blockbuster stores).

    Being innovative or different does not qualify.

    🧭 Step 4: Classification Rules

    Apply criteria mechanically:

    Document each moat type as Present / Not Present

    If present, classify as Wide / Narrow

    Determine direction: Widening / Stable / Narrowing

    Identify 1–2 primary moat sources

    5) Write in plain English—a smart 8th-grader should understand every answer.

    RISK FACTOR FRAMEWORK:

    **1. CONCENTRATION RISK** (Customer Dependence)

    - 🟡 Yellow: Single customer 10-15% of revenue, otherwise diversified
    - 🟢 Green: No customer >10% of revenue, OR millions of individual customers (B2C model)

    Look for: 10-K "Major Customers" section. SEC requires disclosure if any customer >10%.

    **2. DISRUPTION RISK** (Threat of Obsolescence)
    - 🔴 Red: Identifiable disruption threat (new technology, business model shift, aggressive competitor)
    - 🟡 Yellow: Normal competitive environment, no specific disruptive threat
    - 🟢 Green: Company IS the disruptor (first-mover, high R&D, expanding the market)

    Look for: 10-K risk factors mentioning technology or market shifts, news about industry disruption.

    **3. OUTSIDE FORCES** (Regulatory/Political/Macro Risk)
    - 🔴 Red: High exposure (pending legislation, geopolitical risk, heavy regulation)
    - 🟡 Yellow: Normal regulatory environment for the industry
    - 🟢 Green: Minimal outside forces, business model resilient to macro shocks

    Look for: 10-K regulatory risk sections, news about pending legislation, geographic concentration.

    **4. COMPETITION** (Pricing Pressure vs. Market Power)
    - 🔴 Red: Pricing pressure (declining margins, price wars, many competitors)
    - 🟡 Yellow: Normal competition (stable margins, typical competitive environment)
    - 🟢 Green: Monopoly/Duopoly (high gross margins >50%, market leader, few competitors)

    Look for: Gross margin trends from financial data, competitor mentions in transcript/news.

    This analysis uses historical valuation multiples and peer comparisons to determine
    if the stock is undervalued, fairly valued, or overvalued.

    You MUST:
    1) Call historical_multiples_tool({ticker}) to get 10-20 years of historical valuation multiples.
    2) Call peer_comparison_tool({ticker}) to get peer company valuations.
