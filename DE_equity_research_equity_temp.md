 1) Overall Takeaway
* Why It Moved: Deere’s stock moved up 11.07% over the past year, supported by solid revenue growth and beating earnings expectations in several quarters despite pressure on earnings per share and cautious profit guidance. The company’s performance was influenced by mixed demand trends in agriculture and infrastructure markets, with stronger revenues but some earnings declines reflecting operational challenges.
* Next Catalyst: Deere’s next major catalyst is its Q4 2025 earnings release and conference call scheduled for November 26, 2025.
* Outlook (12M): (~) Neutral — Deere’s outlook balances optimism for long-term agricultural mechanization and infrastructure growth with near-term challenges from weakening North American agricultural conditions and cautious profit guidance.

## Assessment

**Overall Score:** 0/5 Green

**Strengths:**
- FCF / Net Income: A decent conversion of net income into free cash flow, showing reasonable cash profitability.

**Concerns:**
- Revenue 3Y CAGR, Interest Coverage, ROIC: Negative revenue growth, low interest coverage, and modest returns on invested capital signal challenges in growth sustainability, financial risk, and capital efficiency.

**Summary:**
Deere & Company is in the capital return phase, meaning it is focused on returning money to shareholders rather than rapid growth. However, its revenue has declined over the last three years, and the company faces some financial risks from relatively low interest coverage. Returns on capital and growth are below ideal levels for a mature business, suggesting caution. While it generates solid free cash flow relative to income and continues capital returns, investors should watch these weaknesses for future financial stress.

# BUSINESS & MOAT

 Moat Analysis: Deere & Company (DE)

Moat Size: Narrow [2nd]  
Moat Direction: Stable ->

Primary Moat Source(s):  
 Switching Costs  
 Low-Cost Production

Summary:  
Deere & Company exhibits a narrow moat primarily driven by substantial switching costs inherent in its large agricultural and construction equipment customer base, coupled with its low-cost production advantages supported by scale and operational efficiency. Despite a recent revenue decline of -11.6% (source: 2025 10-K), Deere maintains strong operating income of $8.4B and a high operating margin of 18.8%, evidencing ongoing pricing and cost control power (source: investment_data_tool). The steady demand for Deere’s specialized, durable machinery and integrated services, paired with its long-standing brand, supports a stable moat durability profile.

 Switching Costs  
Assessment: [Y] Present / Narrow  

Analysis:  
Customers face significant friction in switching from Deere due to product integration with farm operations, dependencies on brand-specific parts and service networks, and the high capital costs of new machinery. Precision agriculture technology embedded within Deere's equipment deepens this lock-in by providing data-driven efficiency gains that are not easily replicated by alternatives. Multi-year service contracts and dealer networks further reinforce customer retention.

Supporting Data:  
- Revenue: $44.7B (TTM)  
- Operating Margin: 18.8% (TTM)  
- Capital Returns: $2.9B in dividends and buybacks, emphasizing maturity and stable cash flows  
Evidence Quote: "Row crop farmers continue to face challenging farm fundamentals... strong crop yields and consumption, new trade agreements... support potential upside." (2025 earnings call transcript) — highlighting customers' dependency and ongoing investment cycles.

 Intangible Assets  
Assessment: [N] Not Present  

Analysis:  
While Deere possesses a well-known brand synonymous with quality, it operates in markets where price sensitivity and competition are significant. The company's patents and technology offerings, while strong, do not provide dominant, exclusive pricing power beyond the switching cost advantages.

Supporting Data:  
- Research & Development to Revenue: 5.18%  
- Intangibles to Assets: 5.2%  
Evidence Quote: Deere’s innovation efforts focus on enhancing productivity but do not rely on exclusive IP barriers to deter competitors.

 Network Effects  
Assessment: [N] Not Present  

Analysis:  
Deere does not benefit materially from network effects where each new user enhances the product’s value for others. Its equipment sales are largely B2B with limited platform or ecosystem network benefits akin to software businesses.

Supporting Data:  
- Customer Growth: Flat to down 11.6% YoY revenue decline reflects no network-driven growth  
Evidence Quote: No direct references to network advantages in filings or transcript.

 Low-Cost Production  
Assessment: [Y] Present / Narrow  

Analysis:  
Deere benefits from operational scale, an efficient supply chain, and manufacturing proficiency enabling competitive cost structures. Its industry-leading operating margin of ~18.8% exceeds many peers in heavy machinery (peers' margins typically below 15%). The firm’s "Smart Industrial Operating Model" underpins lean manufacturing and engineering productivity.

Supporting Data:  
- Operating Margin: 18.8% (better than many peers)  
- Cost of Goods Sold as % Revenue: stable with investments in automation  
Evidence Quote: "Our Smart Industrial Operating Model has driven our growth and success, transforming agriculture and construction through advanced technologies." (2026 Proxy Statement)

 Counter-Positioning  
Assessment: [N] Not Present  

Analysis:  
Deere’s business model is consistent with that of its major competitors. Incumbents can emulate product offerings and operating models without self-harm, hence no structural advantage from counter-positioning.

Supporting Data:  
- Market Presence: Strong but matched by other major OEMs like CNH Industrial and AGCO  
- No mention of disruptive model preventing incumbent response  
Evidence Quote: "We believe this innovative approach has generated significant economic and sustainable value... but competitors continue investing in similar technology." (Proxy Statement summary)

[!] Risks & Final Considerations

Primary Risk:  
Agricultural industry cyclicality and declining large ag equipment demand, as indicated by an anticipated 15-20% decline in North American large equipment sales in FY 2026, pose a risk to Deere’s moat preservation.

Competitive Landscape:  
Major competitors include CNH Industrial, AGCO, and Kubota. Growing importance of precision ag technologies from software and tech firms presents emerging threats. Supply chain challenges and tariffs also add margin pressure.

Valuation Risk:  
Price to Earnings Ratio: 27.7x (TTM), somewhat elevated relative to industrial peers, may reflect optimism priced in for operational resilience.

Morningstar View Comparison:  
Morningstar rates Deere as Narrow Moat with a Stable outlook, citing strong industry position and operational excellence (source: Morningstar). This aligns closely with this independent analysis, confirming Deere’s durable switching costs and cost advantages as moat sources, with limited intangible or network effect contributions.

- **Key Achievements:** Achieved over $5B net income in fiscal 2025 with record operating margins at this cycle stage. Executed key product innovations ahead of peers.
- **Key Misses:** Recent revenue decline (-11.6%) reflects challenging ag market cycle; guidance generally conservative and met but growth slight.

## Overall Management Quality

**Alignment Score:** 3/5 (+) | 2/5 (~) | 0/5 (-)

**Summary:** Deere’s management shows solid alignment with shareholders through robust performance-based compensation and prudent capital allocation, including dividends and share buybacks. Insider ownership, while not substantial, indicates meaningful skin in the game. Communication is transparent and candid, supporting confidence in execution. The track record is generally reliable, though cyclical industry pressures temper outlook.

**Key Concern (if any):** Moderate insider ownership limits strongest skin in the game incentive; cyclicality in agriculture remains an external execution risk.

| **Peer Average** | 26.7x |
| **Valuation Verdict** | (-) Overvalued |

## Historical Multiple Analysis

![Historical P/E Ratio Chart](reports/charts/DE_P_E_Ratio_historical.png)

### Chart Interpretation
- **Current vs Historical:** Current P/E of 27.7x is approximately 63% above the 20-year median of 16.9x.
- **Historical Range:** 8.1x (min) to 26.4x (max in historical data). Current P/E slightly exceeds prior max.
- **Current Percentile:** 100th percentile (highest level in 20 years).

### Outlier Analysis
| Year | Multiple | Likely Cause | Include in Analysis? |
| :---: | :---: | :--- | :---: |
| 2020 | 26.4x | Pandemic market volatility, disrupted earnings | Yes (but flagged as volatile) |
| 2008 | 8.1x | Global Financial Crisis recession impact | Yes |
| 2025 | 27.7x | Current year, unusually high valuation | Yes |

### Phase Change Detection
- **Evidence of Re-rating:** Yes. Around 2018-2020, P/E multiples increased from median ~16-18x to recent highs near 27x, suggesting a permanent upward re-rating likely due to clearer capital return focus and stable cash flows.
- **Pre-2018 Average:** ~14-18x
- **Post-2018 Average:** ~20-27x
- **Implication:** The company’s maturity and capital return priorities have led investors to assign a higher multiple, reflecting stable cash flows and lower perceived risk.

## Peer Comparison Analysis

### Peer Multiples Table
| Company | Ticker | P/E Ratio | vs DE |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Lockheed Martin Corporation | LMT | 32.2x | +16.3% |
| Automatic Data Processing, Inc. | ADP | 25.5x | -7.8% |
| Honeywell International Inc. | HON | 22.8x | -17.6% |
| Union Pacific Corporation | UNP | 19.3x | -30.2% |
| Parker-Hannifin Corporation | PH | 32.8x | +18.7% |
| Eaton Corporation plc | ETN | 34.0x | +22.9% |
| Northrop Grumman Corporation | NOC | 23.8x | -14.0% |
| General Dynamics Corporation | GD | 23.4x | -15.4% |
| **Peer Average** | — | 26.7x | -3.6% |

### Premium/Discount Justification
- **Current Premium/Discount:** DE trades at a modest 3.6% premium to peer average P/E.
- **Justified?** Partially. Deere’s strong operational scale, narrow moat from switching costs, and stable capital returns support a slight premium. However, its cyclicality risks and recent revenue decline temper justification for a wider premium.
- **Key Differentiator:** Significant switching costs from specialized equipment and integrated data services, combined with cost-efficient production, distinguish Deere.

## Valuation Verdict

**Assessment:** (-) Overvalued

**Confidence:** Medium

**Rationale:**  
1) Deere’s current P/E multiple (27.7x) is well above its historical median (16.9x), reaching the highest level in two decades.  
2) Compared to peers, Deere trades slightly above average P/E multiple (3.6% premium), which is modest but notable.  
3) The premium is somewhat justified by Deere’s stable capital returns and narrow moat from durable switching costs, but risks from agricultural market cyclicality and the recent revenue downturn limit this justification.  
4) The current elevated valuation suggests investors are optimistic about Deere’s mature phase and cash flows but should be cautious of cyclical headwinds that may pressure earnings.

**Fair Value Range:** $320 - $370 based on applying the historical median P/E (~17x) to current earnings per share (~$21 estimated EPS)

## Financial Trends

| Revenue | $44.7B | -11.6% | ↓ |
| Gross Margin | 36.5% | -16.4% (gross profit growth) | ↓ |
| Operating Margin | 18.8% | -26.3% | ↓ |
| FCF Margin | 7.2% | -27.0% | ↓ |

## Valuation Context

### Multiples Analysis
- **Current vs Historical:** Deere's current trailing P/E ratio of 27.7x is about 63% higher than its 20-year historical median of 16.9x, reaching one of the highest valuation points in two decades.
- **Current vs Peers:** The P/E multiple is slightly above the peer group average of 26.7x (+3.6%), indicating a modest premium.
- **Premium/Discount Justified?** The premium reflects Deere’s stable cash flows, steady capital returns through dividends and buybacks, and a narrow moat driven by strong switching costs and operational efficiency. However, recent revenue declines, cyclicality in the agriculture sector, and weaker profitability growth limit justification for a higher premium valuation.

### Growth vs Value Check
- **Implied Growth Rate:** The elevated P/E implies investor expectations for stable earnings and continued capital returns rather than high growth.
- **Actual Growth Rate:** Revenue is contracting at roughly -11.6% YoY; 3-year revenue CAGR is negative at -4.5%, signaling current headwinds in the core ag equipment market.
- **Gap Analysis:** The market appears optimistic in maintaining a premium multiple in face of declining revenues and operating income, suggesting caution.

### Red Flags (if any)
- The 3-year revenue decline and significant drop in operating income (-26.3%) contrast with a strong price multiple, indicating a valuation premium not fully backed by growth fundamentals.
- Interest coverage ratio is low at 2.7x, flagged as a warning on financial leverage.
- Return on invested capital (ROIC) at 7.7% is below ideal levels, scoring as a negative metric for capital efficiency.

## Fair Value Estimate

| Scenario | Multiple | Implied Price | vs Current |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Bear Case | 15x P/E | $278 | -46% |
| Base Case | 17x P/E | $316 | -39% |
| Bull Case | 22x P/E | $408 | -21% |

**Methodology:** Scenarios apply conservative, median, and modest premium trailing P/E multiples to Deere’s recent earnings per share (~$18.0-$18.6) reflecting current operating results and capital return phase context. The base case uses the 20-year historical P/E median as fair value reference.

## Investment Verdict

**Valuation Grade:** (-) Overvalued

**Summary:** Deere & Company trades at a substantial premium to its own historical valuation and only modestly above peers, despite facing revenue declines and margin pressure. While its strong cash flow generation and systematic capital returns support a stable business, the stock price reflects high expectations that may not be supported by current earnings trends and cyclicality. Investors should be cautious entering at current prices and consider downside risk if industry conditions worsen.

**Key Consideration:** The primary valuation driver is Deere’s stable capital return and cash flow generation; however, this is offset by declining core revenue growth and moderate financial leverage, leading to an overvalued rating.

## Strengths (Highest Scores)

1. **Business Phase** (5/5): Deere is a mature, capital return company with solid operating income and steady capital returns via dividends and buybacks.  
2. **Business Profile** (4/5): Stable earnings driven by durable goods with moderate pricing power and normal sensitivity to economic cycles.  
3. **Execution Risk & Growth Drivers** (4/5 each): Moderate risks balanced by strong pricing power and steady product innovation sustaining margins.

## Concerns (Lowest Scores)

1. **Key Metrics** (0/5): Negative 3-year revenue CAGR and low interest coverage highlight financial vulnerabilities.  
2. **Visual Valuation** (3/10): Valuation is stretched, with P/E at highest levels in two decades, signaling potential downside risk.  
3. **Price & Sentiment** (3/5): Mixed market sentiment reflects earnings pressure despite revenue growth, indicating investor caution.

***

## Investment Thesis

**Bull Case:** Deere’s status as a mature agricultural and construction equipment leader with a narrow, stable moat supported by high switching costs and operational scale underpins steady cash flows and shareholder returns. Strong pricing power and sustained innovation in precision agriculture provide resilience amid cyclical pressures, appealing to income-focused investors.

**Bear Case:** Cyclical downturn in core agricultural markets, declining revenue trends, financial leverage concerns, and elevated valuation multiples present downside risks. Negative growth metrics and cautious profit guidance suggest investors may face earnings pressure in the near term, amplified by competition and macro uncertainties.

**Bottom Line:** Deere & Company is a well-established, financially mature capital return stock with strong operational foundations, but current valuation levels and weakening financial metrics temper upside potential. The Hold rating reflects balanced risk/reward, favoring investors seeking stability but advising caution against overpaying given cyclicality and execution challenges.
